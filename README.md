# Memory-Game
Memory game exercise from UdacityÂ´s FEND

## How to play
The main objective is to flip up all the cards by matching them by pairs with the same image. You have unlimited chances to uncover them
all, but there is a rating system, where you get:

- 0 circles if you use more than 23 moves.
- 1 circle if you use more than 15 moves.
- 2 circles if you use more than 11 moves.
- 3 circles if you use less than or 11 moves.

To start it is quite straighforward, just click on one card and the timer will start. To restart just hit the replay button or refresh
the page.

## External resources
The game uses jQuey, replay and circles from fontawesome and Montserrat font from Googlefonts. The rest of icons are propietary design.
